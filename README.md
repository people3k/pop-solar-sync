# pop-solar-sync
Meta data file for Freeman et al.: "Global synchrony of human populations and solar energy throughout the Holocene" 

The data consistes to two folders. The first called ``python" contains data and scrips for running a high frequency synchrony analysis of the radiocarbon data and solar energy data. The second folder called "R" contains data files and scripts for running low frequency correlation analysis of the radiocarbon and solar energy data.

Files: Each folder contains data files. The ``python" folder contains five data files: calibdata_all.csv, calibdata200.csv, calibdata300.csv, rawdata_all.csv and rawdata300.csv. The file calibdata_all.csv contains the frequencies of median calibrated radiocarbon ages in 100, 200, and 300 year bins along with the frequency of sunspots. The file rawdata_all.csv contains uncalibrated radiocarbon ages for 5 western states binned at 100 and 300 year intervals. The other files are subsets of these two largerfiles noted by 200, 300, etc (i.e., only 300 year bins).
